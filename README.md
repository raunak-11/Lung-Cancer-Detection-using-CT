# Lung-Cancer-Detection-using-CT
## Project Overview

This project builds an easy-to-use deep learning model that classifies lung CT scan images into Benign, Malignant, or Normal categories. The model uses a transfer learning approach with EfficientNetB0 to achieve accurate predictions with less training time. Accompanied by a simple Flask web app, users can upload images and get quick diagnostic results.
